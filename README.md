## Particle-Filter
This repository contains the necessary code in C++ to localize the position of a self-driving car. The Particle filter algorithm uses the data that the sensors(RADAR, LIDAR) mounted on the car receive to localize it within required accuracy.

The required algorithm and classes used to process the data("particle_filter.h", "particle_filter.cpp") can be found in the src folder.
